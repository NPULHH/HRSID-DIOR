# HRSID-DIOR Dataset

The HRSID-DIOR Dataset is used to support SAR-to-Optical image translation for ship targets.

This dataset is composed of 2 parts:
1) DIOR-ship : 3202 samples containing ship targets from DIOR dataset further augmented and labeled with SAM.
2) HRSID subset: 1031 inshore images and corresponding ship segmentation labels are selected and cropped.
